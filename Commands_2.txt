Create a file as .gitignore and try all these below commands inside that file. Not on terminal/

gitIgnore Rules :-

    *.a : Will ignore all the files with extention .a
    *.[ao] : Will ignore all the files that have extention .a or .o
    !lib.a : Will not ignore lib.a file
    /todo : This will ignore the file. If it's in same directory and irrespective of the location inside that directory. 
            (see diff b/w)
    test/ : Will Ignore all the files in test folder.
    ? : It Matches a single character. 
        Eg- l?b.?xt - this will ignore all the files that starts with l and ends with b and has 1 character in between. 
        Same for extention.
    subDir/ : Will ignore all the files inside subDir directory. (subDir is the name of the directory)

Removing a file :-
    If the file is un modified :
        git rm <filename> : this will remove the file. Then we need to commit and push the file. (No need to add)
    If the file is modified then we need to force remove:
        git rm -f <filename> : this will remove the file. Then we need to commit and push the file. (No need to add)

Command - amend :-
    Syntax : git commit --amend
             Used when we want to add minor changes to last commit without increasing the number of commits or with new commit
             It's used when changes are commited and not pushed
             It replaces the previous commit with the new one
             After running this command a new window will pop up
             Press i to edit the commit message
             Then press ESC and then give :wq to come out of the new window (:wq stands for write and quit)
